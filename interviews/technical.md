# Mastering the technical interview process
Technical interviews assesses your depth and breadth of knowledge for your role. The overall process from start to finish can be upwards of several weeks and consists of multiple stages which vary depending on the company. The intensity and structure of interviews may differ significantly depending on the organization. For example:
- Small startups: 1-2 technical rounds with easy to moderate difficulty.
- Enterprise companies (e.g., banks, utilities): 1-3 technical rounds with easy to moderate difficulty.
- Product companies (e.g., FAANG): 2-3 technical rounds with moderate to hard difficulty.

<br>

Depending on where you're interviewing, you may not experience the comprehensive set of technical rounds. You may also find one company conducts mandatory technical problem solving questions requiring _data structures and algorithms_, yet another may not. Likewise with _system design_. Sometimes a company may not have a formalized process or skilled labour to conduct comprehensive interviews.

## Navigating the technical interview journey
Generic outline of what you can expect.

[TODO]: create summary flowchart


### 1. Coding interview (30 mins - 1 hour)
After initial screening, you'll undergo coding assessments. Expect one to two rounds with the following formats:
- **Online screening:** Timeboxed coding test covering easy to hard questions, emphasizing data structures and algorithms.
- **Take-home assignments:** Solving complex problems over several days or weeks with potential follow-up questions.
- **Whiteboard coding:** Live problem-solving session assessing your approach, architecture decisions, and problem-solving skills. Showcase your ability to dissect a problem, ask questions to obtain clarity, and understand requirements.
  - _eg. architecture, technology choice, why you decided on a specific data structure, runtime complexity, memory complexity, etc_
<br></br>

### 2. System design interview (1 hour)
Showcase your ability to design systems to solve specific problems. You will be given a short description of a problem and asked to design a system with multiple elements brought together to solve it. The interviewer will assess the various aspects of the system, including architecture, scalability, technology choices, resilience, operational excellence, and security.
<br></br>

### 3. General technical interview (1 hour)
Focuses on your overall software development lifecycle knowledge, technical expertise, and experience. Expect questions about your past roles, projects, technologies used, and understanding of domain-specific concepts (best practices, design patterns, trade-offs).

## Preparing for success
Brush up on fundamental skills like data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques. Practice on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeWars, starting with easier problems to build confidence.

### Structuring Your Responses
General evaluation criteria to guide structuring responses to technical questions. Below is an excerpt from [_techinterviewhandbook.org_](https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-prep/)
- **Communication:** Asking clarifying questions, communication of approach and trade-offs clearly such that the interviewer has no trouble following.
- **Problem solving:** Understanding the problem and approaching it systemically, logically and accurately, discussing multiple potential approaches and trade-offs. Ability to accurately determine time and space complexity and optimize them.
- **Technical competency:** Translating discussed solutions to working code with no significant struggle. Clean, correct implementation with strong knowledge of language constructs.
- **Testing:** Ability to test code against normal and corner cases, self-correcting issues in code.

## Closing thoughts
- Pay attention to interviewer behavior for indications of your candidacy status (whether you'll progress to the next stage).
- Understand that failing an interview is an opportunity for growth, not a reflection of your capabilities. Learn from the experience and keep improving.
